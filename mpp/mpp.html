<h2>a message-passing programming interface for f90</h2>
<hr>
<tt>mpp_mod</tt> is a set of simple calls to provide a uniform interface
to different message-passing libraries. It currently can be
implemented either in the SGI/Cray native SHMEM library or in the MPI
standard. Other libraries (e.g MPI-2, Co-Array Fortran) can be
incorporated as the need arises.

<p><a name="introduction"><li><h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>The data transfer between a processor and its own memory is based
on <tt>load</tt> and <tt>store</tt> operations upon
memory. Shared-memory systems (including distributed shared memory
systems) have a single address space and any processor can acquire any
data within the memory by <tt>load</tt> and
<tt>store</tt>. The situation is different for distributed
parallel systems. Specialized MPP systems such as the T3E can simulate
shared-memory by direct data acquisition from remote memory. But if
the parallel code is distributed across a cluster, or across the Net,
messages must be sent and received using the protocols for
long-distance communication, such as TCP/IP. This requires a
``handshaking'' between nodes of the distributed system. One can think
of the two different methods as involving <tt>put</tt>s or
<tt>get</tt>s (e.g the SHMEM library), or in the case of
negotiated communication (e.g MPI), <tt>send</tt>s and
<tt>recv</tt>s.

<p>The difference between SHMEM and MPI is that SHMEM uses one-sided
communication, which can have very low-latency high-bandwidth
implementations on tightly coupled systems. MPI is a standard
developed for distributed computing across loosely-coupled systems,
and therefore incurs a software penalty for negotiating the
communication. It is however an open industry standard whereas SHMEM
is a proprietary interface. Besides, the <tt>put</tt>s or
<tt>get</tt>s on which it is based cannot currently be implemented in
a cluster environment (there are recent announcements from Compaq that
occasion hope).

<p>The message-passing requirements of climate and weather codes can be
reduced to a fairly simple minimal set, which is easily implemented in
any message-passing API. <tt>mpp_mod</tt> provides this API. Features of
<tt>mpp_mod</tt> include:

<p><ul>
<li> Simple, minimal API, with free access to underlying API for
  more complicated stuff.
<li> Design toward typical use in climate/weather CFD codes.
<li> Performance to be not significantly lower than any native API.
</ul>

<p>This module is used to develop higher-level calls for <a
href="mpp_domains.html">domain decomposition</a> and <a
href="mpp_io.html">parallel I/O</a>.

<div class="highlight">

<p>Parallel computing is initially daunting, but it soon becomes
second nature, much the way many of us can now write vector code
without much effort. The key insight required while reading and
writing parallel code is in arriving at a mental grasp of several
independent parallel execution streams through the same code (the SPMD
model). Each variable you examine may have different values for each
stream, the processor ID being an obvious example. Subroutines and
function calls are particularly subtle, since it is not always obvious
from looking at a call what synchronization between execution streams
it implies. An example of erroneous code would be a global barrier
call (see <a href="#mpp_sync"><tt>mpp_sync</tt></a> below) placed
within a code block that not all PEs will execute, e.g:

<p><pre>
if( pe.EQ.0 )call mpp_sync()
</pre>

<p>Here only PE 0 reaches the barrier, where it will wait
indefinitely. While this is a particularly egregious example to
illustrate the coding flaw, more subtle versions of the same are
among the most common errors in parallel code.

<p>It is therefore important to be conscious of the context of a
subroutine or function call, and the implied synchronization. There
are certain calls here (e.g <tt>mpp_declare_pelist, mpp_init,
mpp_malloc, mpp_set_stack_size</tt>) which must be called by all
PEs. There are others which must be called by a subset of PEs (here
called a <tt>pelist</tt>) which must be called by all the PEs in the
<tt>pelist</tt> (e.g <tt>mpp_max, mpp_sum, mpp_sync</tt>). Still
others imply no synchronization at all. I will make every effort to
highlight the context of each call in the MPP modules, so that the
implicit synchronization is spelt out.

Discuss different kinds of sync: pt2pt, global, etc.

<div class="new">
<p>This module has recently undergone considerable revision. In
particular, we now make heavy use of pre-processor directives to
provide functionality for 4-byte and 8-byte variants of <tt>integer,
real, complex, logical</tt> variables, of rank 0 to 5. Changes to this
module pertinent to the latest major revision (6.0) are highlighted as
shown here. (If this paragraph is not highlighted, your browser may
have disabled the use of stylesheets).
</div>

<p><li><h4>mpp_mod call syntax</h4>

<div class="new">
<p>F90 is a strictly-typed language, and the syntax pass of the
compiler requires matching of type, kind and rank (TKR). Most calls
listed here use a generic type, shown here as <tt>MPP_TYPE_</tt>. This
is resolved in the pre-processor stage to any of a variety of
types. In general the MPP operations work on 4-byte and 8-byte
variants of <tt>integer, real, complex, logical</tt> variables, of
rank 0 to 5, leading to 48 specific module procedures under the same
generic interface. Any of the variables below shown as
<tt>MPP_TYPE_</tt> is treated in this way.
</div>

<p>The public interfaces to <tt>mpp_mod</tt> are described here in
alphabetical order:

<ol type="a">

<p><a name="mpp_chksum"><li><h4>mpp_chksum</h4>
<pre>
function mpp_chksum( var, pelist )
  integer(LONG_KIND) :: mpp_chksum
  MPP_TYPE_, intent(in) :: var
  integer, optional :: pelist(:)
</pre>

<p><tt>mpp_chksum</tt> is a parallel checksum routine that returns an
identical answer for the same array irrespective of how it has been
partitioned across processors. <tt>LONG_KIND</tt>is the <tt>KIND</tt>
parameter corresponding to long integers (see discussion on <a
href="os.html">OS-dependent preprocessor directives</a>) defined in
the header file <tt>os.h</tt>. <tt>MPP_TYPE_</tt> corresponds to any
4-byte and 8-byte variant of <tt>integer, real, complex, logical</tt>
variables, of rank 0 to 5.

<div class="new">
<p>Integer checksums on FP data use the F90 <tt>TRANSFER()</tt>
intrinsic.
</div>

<p>The <a href="chksum.html">serial checksum module</a> is superseded
by this function, and is no longer being actively maintained. This
provides identical results on a single-processor job, and to perform
serial checksums on a single processor of a parallel job, you only
need to use the optional <tt>pelist</tt> argument.
<pre>
use mpp_mod
integer :: pe, chksum
real :: a(:)
pe = mpp_pe()
chksum = mpp_chksum( a, (/pe/) )
</pre>

<p>The additional functionality of <tt>mpp_chksum</tt> over
serial checksums is to compute the checksum across the PEs in
<tt>pelist</tt>. The answer is guaranteed to be the same for
the same distributed array irrespective of how it has been
partitioned. <tt>pelist</tt> may be omitted if the array is
partitioned across all PEs.

<div>
<p>This call implies synchronization across the PEs in
<tt>pelist</tt>, or all PEs is <tt>pelist is absent.</tt>
</div>

<p><a name="mpp_error"><li><h4>mpp_error</h4>
<pre>
subroutine mpp_error( errortype, errormsg )
!a very basic error handler
   integer, intent(in) :: errortype
   character(len=*), intent(in), optional :: errormsg
</pre>

<p><tt>errortype</tt> is one of <tt>NOTE</tt>,
<tt>WARNING</tt> or <tt>FATAL</tt> (these definitions
are acquired by use association).

<p><dl>
<dt><tt>NOTE</tt><dd> writes <tt>errormsg</tt> to <tt>STDOUT</tt>.
<dt><tt>WARNING</tt><dd> writes <tt>errormsg</tt> to <tt>STDERR</tt>.
<dt><tt>FATAL</tt><dd> writes <tt>errormsg</tt> to <tt>STDERR</tt>,
and induces a clean error exit with a call stack traceback.
</dl>

<p>It is strongly recommended that all error exits pass through
<tt>mpp_error</tt> to assure the program fails cleanly. An individual
PE encountering a <tt>STOP</tt> statement, for instance, can cause the
program to hang. The use of the <tt>STOP</tt> statement is strongly
discouraged.

<p>The behaviour of <tt>mpp_error</tt> for a <tt>WARNING</tt> can be
controlled with an additional call <tt>mpp_set_warn_level</tt>.

<p><pre>
call mpp_set_warn_level(ERROR)
</pre>

<p>causes <tt>mpp_error</tt> to treat <tt>WARNING</tt>
exactly like <tt>FATAL</tt>.

<p><pre>
call mpp_set_warn_level(WARNING)
</pre>

<p>resets to the default behaviour described above.

<p><a name="mpp_exit"><li><h4>mpp_exit</h4>

<pre>
subroutine mpp_exit
</pre>

<p>Called at the end of the run, or to re-initialize <tt>mpp_mod</tt>,
should you require that for some odd reason.

<p><a name="mpp_init"><li><h4>mpp_init</h4>

<pre>
subroutine mpp_init(flags)
  integer, optional, intent(in) :: flags
</pre>

<p>Called to initialize the <tt>mpp_mod</tt> package. It is recommended
that this call be the first executed line in your program. It sets the
number of PEs assigned to this run (acquired from the command line, or
through the environment variable <tt>NPES</tt>), and associates an ID
number to each PE. These can be accessed by calling <a
href="#mpp_npes"><tt>mpp_npes</tt></a> and <a
href="#mpp_pe"><tt>mpp_pe</tt></a>.

<p><tt>flags</tt> can be set to <tt>MPP_VERBOSE</tt> to
have <tt>mpp_mod</tt> keep you informed of what it's up to.

<div>
<p>This call implies synchronization across all PEs.</tt>
</div>

<p><a name="mpp_malloc"><li><h4>mpp_malloc</h4>

<pre>
subroutine mpp_malloc( ptr, newlen, len )
!routine to perform symmetric allocation:
!this is required on the SGI for variables that will be
! non-local arguments to a shmem call (see man intro_shmem(3F)).
!newlen is the required allocation length for the pointer ptr
!   len is the current allocation (0 if unallocated)
  integer, intent(in) :: newlen
  integer, intent(inout) :: len
</pre>

<p>This routine is used on SGI systems when <tt>mpp_mod</tt> is
invoked in the SHMEM library. It ensures that dynamically allocated
memory can be used with <tt>shmem_get</tt> and
<tt>shmem_put</tt>. This is called <i>symmetric
allocation</i> and is described in the
<tt>intro_shmem</tt> man page. <tt>ptr</tt> is a <i>Cray
pointer</i> (see the section on <a
href="#portability">portability</a>).  The operation can be expensive
(since it requires a global barrier). We therefore attempt to re-use
existing allocation whenever possible. Therefore <tt>len</tt>
and <tt>ptr</tt> must have the <tt>SAVE</tt> attribute
in the calling routine, and retain the information about the last call
to <tt>mpp_malloc</tt>. Additional memory is symmetrically
allocated if and only if <tt>newlen</tt> exceeds
<tt>len</tt>.

<p>This is never required on Cray PVP or MPP systems. While the T3E
manpages do talk about symmetric allocation, <tt>mpp_mod</tt>
is coded to remove this restriction.

<p>It is never required if <tt>mpp_mod</tt> is invoked in MPI.

<div>
<p>This call implies synchronization across all PEs.</tt>
</div>

<p><a name="mpp_max"><li><h4>mpp_max</h4>

<pre>
subroutine mpp_max( a, pelist )
!find the max of scalar a the PEs in pelist
!result is also automatically broadcast to all PEs
   MPP_TYPE_, intent(inout) :: a
   integer, intent(in), dimension(0:), optional :: pelist

subroutine mpp_min( a, pelist )
!find the min of scalar a the PEs in pelist
!result is also automatically broadcast to all PEs
   MPP_TYPE_, intent(inout) :: a
   integer, intent(in), dimension(0:), optional :: pelist
</pre>

<p><tt>a</tt> can be <tt>real</tt> or <tt>integer</tt>.

<div>
<p>This call implies synchronization across the PEs in
<tt>pelist</tt>, or all PEs is <tt>pelist is absent.</tt>
</div>

<p><a name="mpp_npes"><li><h4>mpp_npes</h4>

<pre>
function mpp_npes()
  integer :: mpp_npes
</pre>

<p>This returns the number of PEs participating in this
application. For a uniprocessor application, this will return 1.

<p><a name="mpp_pe"><li><h4>mpp_pe</h4>

<pre>
function mpp_pe()
  integer :: mpp_pe
</pre>

<p>This returns the unique ID associated with a PE. This number runs
between 0 and <tt>npes-1</tt>, where <tt>npes</tt> is the total
processor count, returned by <tt>mpp_npes</tt>. For a uniprocessor
application this will return 0.

<p><a name="mpp_set_stack_size"><li><h4>mpp_set_stack_size</h4>

<p><pre>
subroutine mpp_set_stack_size(n)
  integer, intent(in) :: n
</pre>

<div class="new">

<p><tt>mpp_mod</tt> maintains a private internal array called
<tt>mpp_stack</tt> for private workspace. This call sets the length,
in words, of this array. <p>The <tt>mpp_init</tt> call sets this
workspace length to a default of 32768, and this call may be used if a
longer workspace is needed.

<p>This workspace is symmetrically allocated, as required for
efficient communication on SGI and Cray MPP systems. Since symmetric
allocation must be performed by <i>all</i> PEs in a job, this call
must also be called by all PEs, using the same value of
<tt>n</tt>. Calling <tt>mpp_set_stack_size</tt> from a subset of PEs,
or with unequal argument <tt>n</tt>, may cause the program to hang.

<div>
<p>This call implies synchronization across all PEs.</tt>

<p>If any MPP call using <tt>mpp_stack</tt> overflows the declared
stack array, the program will abort with a message specifying the
stack length that is required. Many users wonder why, if the required
stack length can be computed, it cannot also be specified at that
point. This cannot be automated because there is no way for the
program to know if all PEs are present at that call, and with equal
values of <tt>n</tt>. The program must be rerun by the user with the
correct argument to <tt>mpp_set_stack_size</tt>, called at an
appropriate point in the code where all PEs are known to be present.
</div>
</div>

<p><a name="mpp_sum"><li><h4>mpp_sum</h4>
<pre>
subroutine mpp_sum( a, length, pelist )
!sums array a over the PEs in pelist (all PEs if this argument is omitted)
!result is also automatically broadcast to all PEs
  integer, intent(in) :: length
  integer, intent(in), dimension(:), optional :: pelist
  MPP_TYPE_, intent(inout) :: a
</pre>

<div class="new">

<p><tt>MPP_TYPE_</tt> corresponds to any 4-byte and 8-byte variant of
<tt>integer, real, complex, logical</tt> variables, of rank 0 to 5.

<p>
Library reduction operators are not required or guaranteed to be
bit-reproducible. In any case, changing the processor count changes
the data layout, and thus very likely the order of operations. For
bit-reproducible sums of distributed arrays, consider using the
<tt>mpp_global_sum</tt> routine provided by the <a
href="mpp_domains.html"><tt>mpp_domains</tt></a> module.

<p>The <tt>bit_reproducible</tt> flag provided in earlier versions of

<p><a name="mpp_sync"><li><h4>mpp_sync</h4>

<pre>
subroutine mpp_sync( pelist )
!synchronize PEs in list
  integer, dimension(:), intent(in), optional :: pelist
</pre>

<p>Synchronizes PEs at this point in the execution. If
<tt>pelist</tt> is omitted all PEs are synchronized. This can
be expensive on many systems, and should be avoided if possible. Under
MPI, we do not call <tt>MPI_BARRIER</tt>, as you might
expect. This is because this call can be prohibitively slow on many
systems. Instead, we perform the same operation as
<tt>mpp_sync_self</tt>, i.e all participating PEs wait for
completion of all their outstanding non-blocking operations.

<div>
<p>This call implies synchronization across the PEs in
<tt>pelist</tt>, or all PEs is <tt>pelist is absent.</tt>
</div>

<p><a name="mpp_sync_self"><li><h4>mpp_sync_self</h4>

<pre>
subroutine mpp_sync_self( pelist )
  integer, intent(in), optional :: pelist(:)
</pre>

<p><tt>mpp_transmit</tt> is implemented as asynchronous
<tt>put/send</tt> and synchronous
<tt>get/recv</tt>. <tt>mpp_sync_self</tt> guarantees
that outstanding asynchronous operations from the calling PE are
complete. If <tt>pelist</tt> is supplied,
<tt>mpp_sync_self</tt> checks only for outstanding puts to the PEs in
<tt>pelist</tt>.

<div>
<p>This call implies synchronization across the PEs in
<tt>pelist</tt>, or all PEs is <tt>pelist is absent.</tt>
</div>

<p><a name="mpp_transmit"><li><h4>mpp_transmit</h4>

<pre>
subroutine mpp_transmit( put_data, put_len, put_pe, get_data, get_len, get_pe )
   integer, intent(in) :: put_len, put_pe, get_len, get_pe
   MPP_TYPE_, intent(in),  dimension(put_len) :: put_data
   MPP_TYPE_, intent(out), dimension(get_len) :: get_data
</pre>

<div class="new">
<p><tt>get_data</tt> and <tt>put_data</tt> can be declared as any
4-byte and 8-byte variant of <tt>integer, real, complex, logical</tt>
variables, of rank 0 to 5.
</div>

<p><tt>mpp_transmit</tt> is implemented as asynchronous outward
transmission and synchronous inward transmission. This follows the
behaviour of <tt>shmem_put</tt> and <tt>shmem_get</tt>. In MPI, it is
implemented as <tt>mpi_isend</tt> and <tt>mpi_recv</tt>. For most
applications, transmissions occur in pairs, and are here accomplished
in a single call.

The special PE designations <tt>NULL_PE</tt>,
<tt>ANY_PE</tt> and <tt>ALL_PES</tt> are provided by use
association.

<p><dl>
<dt><tt>NULL_PE</tt><dd> is used to disable one of the pair of
transmissions.
<dt><tt>ANY_PE</tt><dd> is used for unspecific remote
destination. (Please note that <tt>put_pe=ANY_PE</tt> has no meaning
in the MPI context, though it is available in the SHMEM invocation. If
portability is a concern, it is best avoided).
<dt><tt>ALL_PES</tt><dd> is used for broadcast operations.
</dl>

<p>The following example illustrates the use of
<tt>NULL_PE</tt> and <tt>ALL_PES</tt>:

<pre>
real, dimension(n) :: a
if( pe.EQ.0 )then
    do p = 1,npes-1
       call mpp_transmit( a, n, p, a, n, NULL_PE )
    end do
else
    call mpp_transmit( a, n, NULL_PE, a, n, 0 )
end if

call mpp_transmit( a, n, ALL_PES, a, n, 0 )
</pre>

<p>The do loop and the broadcast operation above are equivalent.

<p>Two overloaded calls <tt>mpp_send</tt> and
<tt>mpp_recv</tt> have also been
provided. <tt>mpp_send</tt> calls <tt>mpp_transmit</tt>
with <tt>get_pe=NULL_PE</tt>. <tt>mpp_recv</tt> calls
<tt>mpp_transmit</tt> with <tt>put_pe=NULL_PE</tt>. Thus
the do loop above could be written more succinctly:

<pre>
if( pe.EQ.0 )then
    do p = 1,npes-1
       call mpp_send( a, n, p )
    end do
else
    call mpp_recv( a, n, 0 )
end if

Activate the preprocessor flag <tt>-Duse_libSMA</tt> to invoke
the SHMEM library, or <tt>-Duse_libMPI</tt> to invoke the MPI
library. Global translation of preprocessor macros is required. This
required the activation of the <tt>-F</tt> flag on Cray systems

non-SGI/Cray systems, please consult the f90 manpage for the
equivalent flag.

<p>On Cray PVP systems, <i>all</i> routines in a message-passing

<p>On SGI systems, it is required to use 4-byte integers and 8-byte
reals, and the 64-bit ABI (<tt>-i4 -r8 -64 -mips4</tt>). It is also
required on SGI systems to link the following libraries explicitly:
one of <tt>-lmpi</tt> and <tt>-lsma</tt>, depending on
whether you wish to use the SHMEM or MPI implementations; and
<tt>-lexc</tt>). On Cray systems, all the required flags are
default.

<p>On SGI, use MIPSPro 7.2.1 f90 or higher.
<p>On Cray, use cf90 3.0.0.0 or higher.
<p>On either, use the message-passing toolkit MPT 1.2 or higher.

<p>The declaration <tt>MPI_INTEGER8</tt> for 8-byte integers
was provided by <tt>mpp_mod</tt> because it was absent in early
releases of the Message Passing Toolkit. It has since been included
there, and the declaration in <tt>mpp_mod</tt> commented
out. This declaration may need to be reinstated if you get a compiler
error from this (i.e you are using a superseded version of the MPT).

<p>By turning on the cpp flag <tt>-Dtest_mpp</tt> and compiling
